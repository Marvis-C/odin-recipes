        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>250g of spaghetti</li>
                <li>200g of pancetta</li>
                <li>1 tbsp of olive oil</li>
                <li>6 egg yolks</li>
                <li>120ml of heavy cream</li>
                <li>150g of Parmesan, freshly grated</li>
                <li>black pepper</li>
                <li>salt</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Method</h2>    
            <ol>
                <li>Bring a pot of salted water to the boil to cook the pasta al dente, approximately 7-9 minutes. Meanwhile, cut the pancetta or bacon into matchsticks. Heat the olive oil in a large pan and fry the bacon slowly, so that it releases its own fat before becoming crispy. Season with some black pepper</li>
                <li>In a mixing bowl, beat the egg yolks with the cream and season with salt and pepper. Stir in half the Parmesan cheese and set the remainder aside for garnish</li>
                <li>Drain the cooked pasta thoroughly and immediately add to the pan of hot bacon. Pour in the cream mixture and stir to coat the pasta (the heat from the pasta will cook the egg slightly). Add the remaining Parmesan and serve</li>
            </ol>
